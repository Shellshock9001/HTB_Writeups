# Lame - 10.10.10.3

Started off with a nmap scan
``` markdown
nmap -Pn -T5 -sV -sC -A -p- -oN lame_nmap.txt 10.10.10.3
```
While that was scanning I went to go check out to see if the website is up. But I don't get anything back and you'll see why when the results are done.
We get back some nice info to start us off.
Port 80 isn't open so there was no site for me to check.
