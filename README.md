# HTB_Writeups

## You'll see folders containing the write ups to the machine. I will only post retired machines here. 

## Notes -
If you click on the pdf file you'll see that I use color coding for my notes. This helps me focus attention on that specifc section.
unfortunately this can lead to skipping other information because of speed reading. But it helps me a lot and works for me.
You can choose your own color scheme to match your needs. 

## Color Scheme

- Brown
  * Syntax | I know it looks yellow in the pdf but it's because of the pdf export. It's brown
- Blue
  * Title for specific lesson
- Purple
  * Important to consider involving the syntax, lesson, program version
- Green
  * Vulnerability version
- White
  * Plain text
